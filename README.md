This is my work for the exam_rank_06 at 42.
You will find the subject of the assignment alongside the main that is given.
+ V1 is the first program I came up with that had the expected behavior, but I left in a lot of debug prints that should not end up in the final version (also the code is separated in several files for convenience but you have to turn in a single file).
+ V2 is more or less the version that I wrote during the exam, stripped of the debug prints.
